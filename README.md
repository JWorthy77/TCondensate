# TCondensate
Pedagogical code illustrating HMC and RHMC algorithms for the calculation of the condensate of the planar Thirring model.


The Zolotarev range must be hardcoded in the init routine in diracHMC.f


The choice of HMC solver is also a hardcoded option in diracHMC.f - hmc2domwall, hmc2ol, or rhmc1domwall


The code for the rational functions and the condensate measurements remains horrible.
